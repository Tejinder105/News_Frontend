This alert comes at a crucial time when many crops are in their final stages of growth.\n\nAccording to the weather forecast, a low-pressure system is developing over the Bay of Bengal, which is expected to bring widespread rainfall across northern India, including Haryana. The department predicts moderate to heavy rainfall from June 15 to June 20, with rainfall amounts ranging from 50-100mm in most areas.\n\nFarmers have been advised to take necessary precautions to protect their standing crops. The Agriculture Department has issued guidelines including proper drainage arrangements in fields, harvesting of mature crops before the rains, and protecting harvested grains from moisture.\n\nFor wheat farmers who are in the harvesting phase, officials recommend completing the harvest as soon as possible and storing the grains in dry conditions. Paddy farmers have been advised to ensure proper water management in their fields to prevent waterlogging.\n\nThe local agriculture extension office in Ratia has set up a helpline to provide guidance to farmers regarding crop protection measures. Farmers can call the helpline number for specific advice based on their crop types and field conditions.\n\nThis weather alert is particularly significant as it affects the livelihood of thousands of farmers in the region. The Agriculture Department has also arranged for mobile teams to visit villages and provide on-ground support to farmers in implementing the recommended measures."
