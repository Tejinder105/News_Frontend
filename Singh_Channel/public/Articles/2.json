This initiative, part of the state government's digital education program, aims to bridge the technological gap and provide quality education to students in rural areas.\n\nThe program includes the installation of smart boards, projectors, and computer systems in classrooms. Each school has received equipment worth â‚¹5 lakhs, including interactive whiteboards, audio-visual aids, and educational software. Teachers have also been provided with tablets to enhance their teaching methods.\n\nAccording to the District Education Officer, this initiative will benefit over 5,000 students studying in 15 government schools across Ratia. The digital equipment will make learning more interactive and engaging, helping students understand complex concepts through visual aids and multimedia content.\n\nSpecial training sessions have been conducted for teachers to familiarize them with the new digital tools and teaching methodologies. The training program, which lasted for two weeks, covered topics like using smart boards, creating digital presentations, and integrating technology into the curriculum.\n\nParents and students have welcomed this development with enthusiasm. Many believe that this will help students compete better with their urban counterparts and prepare them for the digital future. The school authorities have assured that regular maintenance and technical support will be provided to ensure the smooth functioning of the equipment.\n\nThis initiative is part of the larger vision to transform education in Haryana and make it more accessible and effective for students in rural areas."
